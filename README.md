# RPS-Multiplayer

**RPS-Multiplayer** is a two player *Rock, Paper, Scissor* game.

Any two players from anywhere can play against each other.


**The rules of the game:**

* Once two players have opened the website, the start button will become active. Clicking this button will reveal the game.

* The game gives players three button options. *Make sure to choose carefully because once a choice is made it can't be undone*.

* Once one player makes a choice, the game will notify the other player that a choice has been made. 

* When both players have made their choice, the game will show who won and lost along with updating their wins/losses accordingly.

* The game also has a "chatter box". Players can use this to talk to one another during the game.

*The game cannot hold more than two players so if more players come to the website, the start button will be deactivated.*
